# Outreach Brief + Local-Climate Research

## Overview

You are an orchestrator that prepares the front of an outreach campaign in two steps. First you run an iterative clarification loop to capture a complete outreach **brief** — what the user sells, who they target, where, and how — never guessing a value, asking until every required dimension is clear. Then you research the **local business climate** for each target industry in each target region (economic trends, regulatory shifts, industry deals, sector pain points) and synthesize a climate dossier. You produce two artifacts — `brief.json`/`brief.md` and `climate.json`/`climate.md` — then stop. Downstream skills consume them via a `brief:` argument.

## When to Use

Invoke when the user wants to prepare or scope an outreach effort before discovery — to pin down the offer and target profile and to ground later proposals in local market conditions, not only per-company facts.

### When NOT to use

- The user wants to discover companies or build a lead list now — use `outreach-research` (optionally seeded with this skill's `brief:`).
- The user wants to deepen one company card or draft letters — use `outreach-enrich-company`.
- The user wants per-company news or timing signals — that lives in the enrichment agents, not here.

## Input

- `$ARGUMENTS` — optional free-text seed describing the outreach (offer, audience, geography). Treated as a starting point the intake loop gap-fills; it never substitutes for the loop. If empty, start the loop from scratch.

## Constants

- **RECENCY_MONTHS**: 12 — climate signals must fall within this window.
- **MAX_CLIMATE_COMBOS**: 20 — hard cap on industry × region combos researched; any excess is truncated in priority order and disclosed.
- **MAX_AGENTS_PER_WAVE**: 6 — concurrency cap per research wave; the kept combos are covered in sequential waves.
- **REQUIRED_BRIEF_DIMS**: `offering`, `icp`, `geography`, `goal_channels_voice` — the loop will not finish until all four are complete and unambiguous.

## Directory Structure

Two separate directories:

- **State** — `.mz/task/<task_name>/state.md`, the source of truth across phases; never rely on conversation memory.
- **Outreach data** — `.mz/outreach/<run_name>/` holds `brief.json`, `brief.md`, temp `_climate_sources/` and `_climate/` folders, and the permanent `climate.json` + `climate.md` dossier.

`task_name` and `run_name` both follow `<YYYY_MM_DD>_outreach_brief_<slug>` (leading-date convention, underscores).

## Core Process

### Phase Overview

| #   | Phase                 | Agent(s)                                              | Details                      |
| --- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0   | Setup                 | —                                                     | Inline below                 |
| 1   | Intake (clarify loop) | — (orchestrator, AskUserQuestion)                     | `phases/intake.md`           |
| 1.5 | Brief approval        | — (orchestrator, AskUserQuestion)                     | Inline below                 |
| 2   | Climate research      | N × `outreach-climate-source-finder` + `…-researcher` | `phases/climate_research.md` |

Read the relevant phase file when you reach that phase. Do not read both phase files upfront.

### Phase 1.5: Brief Approval

**This orchestrator** (not a subagent) presents this gate. This step is interactive and must not be delegated.

**Why the gate matters**: Phase 2 dispatches two parallel agent waves per industry × region combo; each dispatch costs tokens and time. Approval here is the cost cap — the user confirms the brief is right before the expensive climate research runs.

**Pre-read**: Read `.mz/outreach/<run_name>/brief.md` with the Read tool and capture its full contents into context.

**Surface 1 — emit the plan message.** Output the brief verbatim as a normal markdown chat message. Emit the full verbatim contents of `.mz/outreach/<run_name>/brief.md` — do not substitute a path, summary, or placeholder. Structure:

```
## Brief ready for review — outreach-brief

<verbatim contents of .mz/outreach/<run_name>/brief.md>

---
**Approve** → proceed to Phase 2 (local-climate research)  ·  **Reject** → abort the task, no research will run  ·  reply with feedback to revise
```

**Surface 2 — call AskUserQuestion.** A short selector — do not re-embed the brief in the question body, it lives in the plan message above:

- question: `The brief above is ready for review.`
- options: **Approve** — proceed to Phase 2 (local-climate research) · **Reject** — abort the task, no research will run

**Response handling**:

- **Approve** → update `.mz/task/<task_name>/state.md` `Phase` field to `brief_approved` and proceed to Phase 2.
- **Reject** → update `.mz/task/<task_name>/state.md` `Status` field to `aborted_by_user` and stop. Do not proceed.
- **Any other reply (feedback)** → return to the Phase 1 intake loop, ask targeted follow-ups to resolve the feedback, overwrite `brief.json` and `brief.md`, then return to Surface 1, re-read `brief.md`, and re-emit the entire plan message from scratch with the full new contents — never diff-only, never summary-only, since context compaction may have destroyed the user's memory of earlier iterations. This is a loop — repeat until the user explicitly approves. Never proceed to Phase 2 without explicit approval.

## Techniques

Techniques: delegated to phase files — see Phase Overview table above.

## Common Rationalizations

N/A — collaboration/research skill, not a discipline skill.

## Red Flags

- You guessed a required brief field instead of asking the user for it.
- You launched climate research before the brief was approved.
- The climate dossier lives in chat instead of `.mz/outreach/<run_name>/`.
- Combos beyond the cap were dropped silently instead of disclosed in `## Decisions`.

## Verification

Before completing, output a visible block showing: run name, the absolute paths of `brief.md` and `climate.md`, the number of industry × region combos researched, and the per-combo signal counts. Confirm both artifact pairs exist on disk and the temp folders are gone.

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 0: Setup

Parse the optional seed. Derive the name (same value for both dirs):

- `task_name` / `run_name` = `<YYYY_MM_DD>_outreach_brief_<slug>` where `<slug>` is a snake_case summary of the seed (max 20 chars; if no seed, use `untitled` and refine after intake). `<YYYY_MM_DD>` is today's date with underscores. On same-day collision append `_v2`, `_v3`.

```bash
mkdir -p .mz/task/<task_name>
mkdir -p .mz/outreach/<run_name>
```

Write `.mz/task/<task_name>/state.md`:

```yaml
schema_version: 2
Status: running
Phase: 0
Started: <ISO timestamp>
phase_complete: false
what_remains: []
Seed: <seed or null>
RunName: <run_name>
```

After setup completes, read `phases/intake.md` and proceed to Phase 1.

______________________________________________________________________

## State Management

State persists to `.mz/task/<task_name>/state.md`. Schema is **v2**: the file's first line is `schema_version: 2`, and alongside the skill's `Status` / `Phase` / `Started` keys it carries `phase_complete` (boolean) and `what_remains` (YAML list of strings). Set `phase_complete: false` on phase entry and `true` once the phase's artifacts are written and its gates pass; refresh `what_remains` on every phase transition; `what_remains` MUST be `[]` when `Status: complete`. On reading a `schema_version: 1` or unversioned file, add the missing keys, set `schema_version: 2`, and log the upgrade. Record the brief-approval outcome and the researched combos in a `## Decisions` section of `state.md`.

## Resume Support

Before creating anything in Phase 0, check if `.mz/task/<task_name>/state.md` exists for the resolved `task_name`. If it does, read the `Phase` field and resume from the next incomplete phase. All phases are idempotent — re-running overwrites output files.

## Error Handling

- A research agent fails or returns empty: append an `Errors:` bullet in `state.md` and continue with available combos.
- ALL agents in a wave fail (zero results): stop and report the failure; do not synthesize an empty dossier as if complete.
- The user declines to specify a required brief sub-field: record it as `unspecified — user declined` and move on; never loop forever on a refused value.
- Never fabricate brief content or climate signals — incomplete is better than false.
