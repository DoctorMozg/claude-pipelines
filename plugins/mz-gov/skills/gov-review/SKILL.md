# Governance Artifact Review (read-only)

## Overview

Audits already-written governance artifacts — ADRs, RFDs, and design docs — against a six-axis quality rubric and reports where they fall short. Globs the artifact directories (or a user-supplied path/glob), fans `gov-audit-reviewer` out one-per-artifact, collects each `VERDICT:`, and writes a single ranked review report with a per-artifact table plus an aggregate roll-up. This skill reads and reports only — it never edits an artifact. Hand the report to `govern` (to re-decide a failing record) or fix the artifact by hand.

## When to Use

- The user wants existing decision records checked for quality, not a new decision made.
- Triggers: "review our ADRs", "audit our decision records", "check the governance docs", "are our ADRs any good".
- One artifact or a whole directory — the skill fans out across however many it finds.

### When NOT to use

- Making or recording a **new** decision — use `govern`.
- Reviewing **code** for bugs or a branch diff — use `audit` or `review-branch`.
- Writing or fixing an artifact — this skill is read-only; it produces findings, not edits.

## Input

- `$ARGUMENTS` — Optional. A path or glob to the artifacts to review (`docs/decisions/0003-*.md`, `docs/rfcs/`, a single file), and/or one of the dir hints `docs/decisions` | `docs/rfcs` | `docs/design`. If empty, the audit phase globs all three default artifact directories. Ambiguous or unrecognizable input → ask via AskUserQuestion, never guess.

## Approval gate

None. This skill is read-only — it scores artifacts and writes a report under `REPORT_DIR`, modifying no governance artifact — so no user approval gate is required. The reviewer agents are likewise read-only (`Read, Grep, Glob`).

## Constants

- **MAX_REVIEWERS**: 6 (parallel `gov-audit-reviewer` agents per wave; overflow runs in sequential waves)
- **TASK_DIR**: `.mz/task/`
- **REPORT_DIR**: `.mz/reviews/`
- **ARTIFACT_DIRS**: `docs/decisions/*.md`, `docs/rfcs/*.md`, `docs/design/*.md` (the default glob set when no path/glob is supplied)

## Core Process

### Phase Overview

| #   | Phase | Reference         | Loop? |
| --- | ----- | ----------------- | ----- |
| 0   | Setup | inline below      | —     |
| 1   | Audit | `phases/audit.md` | —     |

### Phase 0: Setup

1. **Parse the argument.** Split `$ARGUMENTS` into tokens. A token that is a path, a glob (contains `*`/`?`), or an existing directory becomes the artifact source. A bare dir hint (`docs/decisions` | `docs/rfcs` | `docs/design`) selects that one directory. No path/glob token → the audit phase falls back to **ARTIFACT_DIRS**. If a token is unrecognizable (neither a path, a glob, nor a dir hint), ask via AskUserQuestion which artifacts to review — never guess a source.
1. **Derive the task name** `<YYYY_MM_DD>_gov-review_<slug>` where `<YYYY_MM_DD>` is today's date with underscores and `<slug>` is a snake_case summary (max 20 chars) of the argument (e.g. `decisions`, `all_docs`); on same-day collision append `_v2`, `_v3`.
1. **Create** `TASK_DIR<task_name>/` and **write `state.md`** per the inline v2 contract below — `Status: running`, `Phase: 0`, the parsed artifact source, and the resolved **REPORT_DIR** report path.
1. **Emit a visible setup block**: `task_name`, the artifact source (parsed glob/path or "default ARTIFACT_DIRS"), **MAX_REVIEWERS**, and the report path. Then read `phases/audit.md` and run Phase 1.

### Phase 1: Audit

Glob the artifact source, dispatch `gov-audit-reviewer` per artifact (parallel up to **MAX_REVIEWERS**, sequential overflow waves, each wave with a pre-dispatch manifest and a post-wave rollup), collect every `VERDICT:`, and write the review report to **REPORT_DIR**. See `phases/audit.md`. If zero artifacts are found, report that clearly and stop — do not fabricate findings.

## Techniques

Techniques: delegated to `phases/audit.md` (glob resolution, wave batching, manifest/rollup, report shape) and `references/review-rubric.md` (the six-axis scoring rubric the reviewer applies).

## Common Rationalizations

Common Rationalizations: delegated to the `gov-audit-reviewer` agent — its anti-rationalization table covers the audit-discipline excuses (softening a `Critical:`, passing a `pending` sign-off, rounding a single Critical up to PASS).

## Red Flags

Red Flags: delegated to `phases/audit.md` and the `gov-audit-reviewer` agent. The orchestrator-level red flag: dumping the full report inline instead of reporting its path, or claiming a verdict for an artifact whose reviewer returned no `VERDICT:` line.

## Verification

Output a final block: the report path under **REPORT_DIR**, the aggregate roll-up (N artifacts reviewed, M failing), and the per-artifact verdict list. Confirm the report file exists. If any reviewer returned no `VERDICT:`, name that artifact as unscored rather than counting it as a pass.

## Error Handling

- **Zero artifacts found** at the resolved source → report it (the directories may be empty or the glob too narrow) and stop. Do not invent artifacts.
- **Unrecognizable argument** → escalate via AskUserQuestion before Phase 1; never guess the source.
- **A reviewer returns `BLOCKED` / `NEEDS_CONTEXT` / no `VERDICT:`** → record it in the report as unscored (not a pass) and continue with the rest; retry a single empty dispatch once before marking it unscored.
- Never guess on ambiguity — escalate via AskUserQuestion.

## State Management

State persists to `TASK_DIR<task_name>/state.md`. Schema is **v2**: the file's first line is `schema_version: 2`, and alongside `Status` / `Phase` / `Started` it carries `phase_complete` (boolean) and `what_remains` (YAML list of strings). Set `phase_complete: false` on phase entry and `true` once the phase's artifacts are written and its gates pass; refresh `what_remains` on every phase transition; `what_remains` MUST be `[]` when `Status: complete`. On reading a `schema_version: 1` or unversioned file, add the missing keys, set `schema_version: 2`, and log the upgrade.
